# ShowCase NorthShore-android

ShowCase library is a library based on [ShowCaseView](https://github.com/mreram/ShowCaseView). It is adopted to fulfill the needs of the NorthShore app.
The library is kept in a private repository, and is used for internal purposes only; because of this, the library is not distributed in any remote package manager/repository. 
Instead, the library is distributed locally using mavenLocal() repository.

NOTE: <b>The library will be kept up-to-date with possible changes in the ShowCaseView library, so subscribing to receive notifications when changes occur is required.</b>

## Distribution
To make the library available for usage in your local environment, the following steps need to be followed:
* Clone the library in your machine
  * git clone git@github.com:NorthShore-University-HealthSystem/ShowCaseView.git
* Open a terminal and go to the directory of the project
* Execute the following command: ``./gradlew publish``

Now the library should be published in your local maven repository, and you can proceed with using it.
